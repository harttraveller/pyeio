# pyeio

This is a python library for data input/output operations. This library prioritizes developer experience, standardization, and global interoperability/format support over speed. For instance, if you want something faster than [orjson](https://github.com/ijl/orjson) for handling JSON data, you should something like [msgspec](https://jcristharif.com/msgspec/).
