# pyeio

Short for `Py`thon `E`asy `I`nput `O`utput, `pyeio` is a python library meant to simplify file IO processes.

```bash
pip install pyeio
```

For example, you can use it to avoid rewriting the code below hundreds of times.

```python
import json
with open("data/example.json", "r") as file:
    data = json.load(file)
file.close()
```

By simplifying it to the following line.

```python
from pyeio import easy
data = easy.load("data.json")
```
