## Support Definition

## File Formats



<!-- ## Capabilities

This package only deals with data formats that can be loaded into native python data structures, pandas dataframes, and arrays/matrices that can be handled by numpy. To minimize dependencies and scope creep, it:

1. Doesn't deal with data formats that require a continual connection to the data source (eg: sqlite databases).
2. Doesn't include syntax parsers for executable/interpreted languages (eg: python, javascript). This means that while you can load python or javascript, these are treated as plain text. If you want to navigate the AST, this should be handled separately.
3. Doesn't include packages for handling complex data formats. For example, you can load a PDF as a binary file, or even as the raw text defining the files internal schema (you almost certainly don't want to do this), but PDF parsers like pdfplumber/pdfminer aren't included, because if they were included for PDF then to be consistent dependencies and support for a [ton of other formats](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/articles/List_of_file_formats) would also have to be included, which is totally out of scope. -->
